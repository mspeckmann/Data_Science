**regular_expressions_practice.py** -> This was created to practice parsing out a list of ICD-10 codes from a table in a pdf. The table included codes separated by commas that needed to be injested in a way that could be used to include or exclude those codes when joined with claims.

Prompt: Robert has started his own mobile company. He wants to give tough fight to big companies like Apple, Samsung etc.
He does not know how to estimate price of mobiles his company creates. In this competitive mobile phone market, you cannot simply assume things. To solve this problem, he collects sales data of mobile phones of various companies.
Robert wants to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone (e.g.: - RAM, Internal Memory etc.) and its selling price. But he is not so good at Machine Learning. So, he needs your help to solve this problem.
