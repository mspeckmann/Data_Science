This repository includes miscellaneous projects that I have worked on outside of work and volunteering. 

**regular_expressions_practice.py** -> This was created to practice parsing out a list of ICD-10 codes from a table in a pdf. The table included codes separated by commas that needed to be injested in a way that could be used to include or exclude those codes when joined with claims.

**KNN Model** -> 
Prompt: Robert has started his own mobile company. He wants to give tough fight to big companies like Apple, Samsung etc.
He does not know how to estimate price of mobiles his company creates. In this competitive mobile phone market, you cannot simply assume things. To solve this problem, he collects sales data of mobile phones of various companies.
Robert wants to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone (e.g.: - RAM, Internal Memory etc.) and its selling price. But he is not so good at Machine Learning. So, he needs your help to solve this problem.

Content: Folder includes a Jupyter Notebook with EDA and model building (KNN), test CSV, train CSV, the file to run the model, and predicted output.

**Generic Medical and Genomic Model with Synthetic Data** ->
Prompt: Investigate and analyze the data set, producing a model that can be used to predict the target. You are given a targets.csv, patient_profiles.json, and biomarkers.csv. The information in the last 2 files should be used to predict the targets in targets.csv.

Outputs:
* 1_Load_patient_profiles_json.ipynb --> Translates JSON to CSV
* 2_Analysis & Basic Clean Up.ipynb --> EDA & Data Mining
* 3_Build Model.ipynb --> Model build and Results
